# Introduction

A couple years back I really got into [Nintendo DS homebrew development](https://github.com/jdriselvato/NDS-Development). It was very easy to break into considering the SDKs had existed for nearly a decade and emulators were near perfection. I hadn't any interest in learning 3DS homebrew development yet because Nintendo console lifecycle wasn't over. 

Earlier this year Nintendo announced that it would be closing the eshop, it's app store, March 27, 2023. and as of August 29, 2022 no one can add funds to their account to purchase from the eshop. This also meant that the 3DS would soon stop getting updates and the Nintendo Switch will be their biggest focus. 

Last month I finally decided to hack my 3DS with custom firmware and with Outdoorsy Lab day, I am finally getting a chance to mess around with homebrew development on the system. This repo is write up of the research and progress I made onf the first Lab day (Nov 16th, 2022).
